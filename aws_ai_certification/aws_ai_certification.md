## Concepts <a id="Concepts"></a>

### Foundation Model <a id="FoundationModel"></a>

Trained on __very large data__ set of unlabeled different types of data.

Very expensive to train (resources, time, money)

Examples: gpt40

### LLM <a id="LLM"></a>

LLM = __large language models__. Designed to generate human-like text.

Trained on large corpus of text data (books, articles etc.), billions of parameters, 

Can perform language related tasks: translation, summarization, question answering, content creation.

Prompt: to query LLM you send a prompt. It can be text and pictures etc.

Output of a prompt is not deterministic and it can be many different data types (text, image etc.)

All foundational language models are LLMs, but not all LLMs are foundational models—only those trained at sufficient scale and generality.


### RAG <a id="RAG"></a>

- Allows a Foundation Model to reference a __data source outside of its training data__
- Retrieval - because we retrieve the data outside foundational model
- Augmented - because __augment the prompt with data that has been retrieved__ from vector database

### Tokenization <a id="Tokenization"></a>

Converting raw text into a sequence of tokens
- Word-based tokenization: text is split into individual words
- Subword tokenization: some words can be split too

Words split into multiple tokens: unbelievable -> ['un', 'believ', 'able']

### Context Window <a id="ContextWindow"></a>

- The number of tokens an LLM can consider when generating text
- The larger the context window, the more information and coherence
- Large context windows require more memory and processing power

![ Context Window Comparison ](./images/context_window_comparison.gif)

### Embeddings <a id="Embeddings"></a>

- Create vectors (array of numerical values) out of text, images or audio
- Vectors have a high dimensionality to capture many features for one input token, such as semantic meaning, syntactic role, sentiment
- Embedding models can power search applications
- Words that have semantic relationships (i.e. are similar) will have similar embeddings (vector) and then we can do similarity search

## AI and ML <a id="AIML"></a>

### Machine Learning (ML) <a id="ML"></a>

- ML is a type of AI for building __methods that allow machines to learn__
- Data is leveraged to improve computer performance on a set of task
- __Make predictions based on data__ used to train the model: regression, classification, decision trees or Neural Networks


#### Supervised Learning (ML)

__Regression__:
- Used to predict a numeric value based on input data
- The output variable is continuous, meaning it can take any value within a range
- Examples: Predicting House Prices, Stock Price Prediction, Weather Forecasting

__Classification__:
- Used to predict the categorical label of input data
- The output variable is discrete, which means it falls into a specific category or class

![ Supervised Learning](./images/supervised_learning.gif)

##### Training vs. Validation vs. Test Set:
- __Training Set__
  - Used to train the model
  - Percentage: typically, 60-80% of the dataset
- __Validation Set__
  - Used to tune model parameters and validate performance
  - Percentage: typically, 10-20% of the dataset
- __Test Set__
  - Used to evaluate the final model performance
  - Percentage: typically, 10-20% of the dataset

#### Feature Engineering:
- The process of using domain knowledge to select and __transform raw data into meaningful features__
- Helps enhancing the performance of machine learning models
- Techniques
  - __Feature Extraction__ – extracting useful information from raw data, such as deriving age from date of birth
  - __Feature Selection__ – selecting a subset of relevant features, like choosing important predictors in a regression model
  - __Feature Transformation__ – transforming data for better model performance, such as normalizing numerical data
- Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms
  - Feature Creation – deriving new features like 'price per square foot'
  - Feature Selection – identifying and retaining important features such as location or number of bedrooms
  - Feature Transformation – normalizing features to ensure they are on a similar scale

Feature Engineering on Unstructured Data:
- Example: sentiment analysis of customer reviews
- Feature Engineering Tasks
  - Text Data – converting text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings
  - Image Data – extracting features such as edges or textures using techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

#### UnSupervised Learning (ML)

The goal is to __discover inherent patterns__, structures, or relationships __within the input data__.
The machine must uncover and create the groups itself, but __humans still put labels__ on the output groups.
Unsupervised learning involves __iterating until some objective function is minimized__.

Examples:
- __K-Means Clustering__ Technique: group similar data points together into clusters based on their features
- __Association Rule Learning__: supermarket wants to understand which products are frequently bought together
  - Apriori: finds frequent itemsets by iteratively extending them, pruning infrequent ones.
  - Eclat: Uses a depth-first search and vertical data format (item → list of transactions).
- __Anomaly Detection__: detect fraudulent credit card transactions
- __Autoencoders__ – compressing data into a lower-dimensional representation


__Semi-supervised Learning:__ 
- Use a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train systems
- the partially trained algorithm itself labels the unlabeled data
- model is then re-trained on the resulting data mix without being explicitly programmed
- Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. It lies between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Use it when:
  - Labeling data is expensive or time-consuming (e.g., medical images, legal documents).
  - Unlabeled data is abundant and easy to collect (e.g., website text, sensor data).

#### Self-Supervised Learning

Steps:
- Have a __model generate pseudo-labels__ for its own data without having humans label any data first
- Then, __using the pseudo labels, solve problems traditionally solved by Supervised Learning__
- Widely used in __NLP__ (to create the BERT and GPT models for example) and in __image recognition__ tasks

Example:
- Create 'pre-text tasks' to have the model solve simple tasks and learn patterns in the dataset
- Pretext tasks are not 'useful', but will teach our model to create a 'representation' of our dataset
- Predict any part of the input from any other part:
  - Amazon Web ??? -> Services
  - provides on-demand cloud ??? -> computing
  - APIs to individuals, ???, and governmants -> companies
- After solving the pre-text tasks, we have a model trained that can solve our end goal: 'downstream tasks'

Examples of Self-Supervised Learning:
- BERT (Masked Language Modeling) – predicts missing words
- SimCLR / MoCo (Contrastive Learning) – learns visual features by comparing augmented views of the same image
- GPT (Next-token prediction) – predicts the next word given previous context


#### Reinforcement Learning (RL)

A type of Machine Learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards

Key Concepts:
- Agent – the learner or decision-maker
- Environment – the external system the agent interacts with
- Action – the choices made by the agent
- Reward – the feedback from the environment based on the agent’s actions
- State – the current situation of the environment
- Policy – the strategy the agent uses to determine actions based on the state

Learning process:
- The Agent observes the current State of the Environment
- It selects an Action based on its Policy
- The environment transitions to a new State and provides a Reward
- The Agent updates its Policy to improve future decisions
- Goal: Maximize cumulative reward over time

Example: training a robot to navigate a maze

Use cases:
- Gaming – teaching AI to play complex games (e.g., Chess, Go)
- Robotics – navigating and manipulating objects in dynamic environments
- Finance – portfolio management and trading strategies


### Deep Learning <a id="DeepLearning"></a>

- Process __more complex patterns__ in the data than traditional ML
- Requires large amount of input data and GPUs
- __Computer Vision__ – image classification, object detection, image segmentation
- Natural Language Processing (__NLP__) – text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, language generation
  - __Intent analysis:__ You could use it to analyze feedback or call center recordings.
    - Figure out using NLP, what are the m__ain issues that people are calling in about__ when they call my customer service reps?
    - Use NLP to figure out automatically whether or not people are happy or not and what the main issues are that they're facing.

__The 'neural network' represents the 'meaning' that can be translated into many languages__.

Types of Neural Networks:

#### Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (__CNN__)

- Usually used for __image recognition__ (find features within images), machine translation
- Used when you have __data that does not nicely align into columns__
- __Can find features__ that are not in a specific spot
- Instead of analyzing all pixels at once, it looks at small local patterns and builds up understanding from simple to complex.
  - For a photo of a cat, a CNN might:
    - Detect edges and textures.
    - Combine edges into shapes (ears, eyes).
    - Recognize object parts (face).
    - Classify the object as a “cat.”
- Works like eye:
  - take source image or data
  - break is into smaller chunks called convolutions
  - assemble convolutions and look for patterns

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (__RNN__)

- Used for __sequences of data__ (like __time series__, or machine translations (words) or music(notes))
- __Output of the neuron goes back into the same neuron__ (feedback loop)
- A sequence of words is encoded into neural network and later this neural network can be decoded into words in anothe language (translation).
- As neural networks get deeper, they should perform better—but in practice, they often get worse due to: Vanishing gradient, Overfitting, Training instability
- __ResNet__ (Residual Network) – Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for image recognition tasks, object detection, facial recognition
  - ResNet introduces shortcut (skip) connections that allow gradients and data to flow more easily through the network.

#### __Transformer__ Architecture

- __RNN + self attention__ (=tention/relationship between words)
- Each word can have many parallel 'states' or 'attentions'
- Transformers = stop using RNN and instead use __normal neural network with attentions__
- Structure: Uses self-attention mechanisms, no recurrence.
- Use Case: Language understanding, translation, generative AI.
- Example: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT, ChatGPT.

#### Generative Adversarial Networks (__GAN__)

- Used for face-swapping or aging applications, generate __synthetic data such as images, videos__ or sounds that resemble the training data. Helpful for data augmentation
- Generator maps random noise to an image
- Discriminator learns to identify real images from generate/fake images
- Generator and Discriminator are adversarial.
- Ends when Discriminator cannot tell the difference between fake and real image 
- Structure: Two networks — a generator and a discriminator — compete to improve each other.
- Use Case: Generating realistic data (images, text, audio).
- Example: Deepfake generation, art synthesis.   

#### Autoencoder

- Structure: Encoder compresses input; decoder reconstructs it.
- Use Case: Dimensionality reduction, denoising, anomaly detection.
- Example: Compressing images or detecting fraudulent transactions

#### Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network

- Structure: Uses radial basis functions as activation functions.
- Use Case: Function approximation, classification.
- Example: Signal processing tasks.

#### __BERT__ (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 

- similar intent to GPT, but reads the text in two directions
- Previous Models (like GPT or traditional RNNs): Process text in a unidirectional manner, meaning they understand the context of a word from only one direction (either left-to-right or right-to-left). 
- BERT: Is bidirectional, meaning it processes the entire context of a word simultaneously from both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left). This allows BERT to fully capture the nuances of meaning from both sides

#### __SVM__ (Support Vector Machine) – ML algorithm for __classification and regression__

#### __WaveNet__ – model to generate __raw audio waveform__, used in Speech Synthesis

#### XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) – an implementation of gradient boosting
  - It is a boosting technique that builds multiple models sequentially, with each model trying to correct the errors of the previous one.
  - XGBoost uses __decision trees__ as the base learners.
  - Boosting is an ensemble learning technique where multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) are combined to create a strong learner
  - Gradient Boosting involves fitting new models (trees) that correct the residuals of the models before them. The "gradient" refers to the gradient descent optimization technique used to minimize errors, which makes the models progressively better at predicting the target.
  - The "Extreme" in XGBoost refers to the fact that it is a highly optimized, scalable, and efficient version of gradient boosting.

#### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Structure: Special types of RNNs with gates to manage long-term dependencies.
  - Use Case: Long sequences like text or music.
  - Example: Machine translation, speech recognition. 

#### __GPT__ (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

  - __generate human text__ or computer code based on input prompts. create new content or data (text,imae,voice) that resembles existing data using a model like transformer
  - transformers
    - LLM
    - Multi-Modal

#### __Diffusion Models__

  - They gradually transforming noise into structured data through a process inspired by physical diffusion
  - The diffusion process in these models refers to the gradual addition of noise to data over several steps
  - Used to generate images
  - Take text and create embeddings
  - Add random changes to image
  - After several iterations reverse this process
  - Result it image similar to the original.
  - Output of embedding is not text buy image or sound

### Generative AI (Gen-AI) <a id="GenAI"></a>

Foundation models use self-supervised learning to create labels from input data. This means no one has instructed or trained the model with labeled training data sets.

Fine-tuning involves further training a pre-trained language model on a specific task or domain-specific dataset, allowing it to address business requirements. __Fine-tuning is a customization method that does change the weights of your model__.
Fine-tuning an FM is a supervised learning process.

__FMs use self-supervised learning to create labels from input data__, however, __fine-tuning an FM is a supervised learning process__.

- Multi-purpose foundation models backed by __neural networks__
- They can be fine-tuned if necessary to better fit our use-cases: text generation, text summarization, chatbot, image generation
- They Leverage Transformer model (__LLM__) - for text
  - Able to process a sentence as a whole instead of word by word
  - Faster and more efficient text processing
  - gives relative importance to specific words in a sentence (more coherent sentences)
  - models that can understand and generate human-like text
  - Trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, books, and other sources
  - Example: Google BERT, OpenAI ChatGPT
- __Diffusion models__ - for images
- __Multi-modal Models__ (ex: GPT-4o)
  - Does NOT rely on a single type of input (text, or images, or audio only)
  - Does NOT create a single type of output
  - Example: a multi-modal can take a mix of audio, image and text and output a mix of video, text
  - "Generate a video of making the picture of the cat speak the audio that is included"
  - LLMs and Diffiusion models are still __2 different neural networks__, but they communicate:
    - LLM generates a text description or prompt, which is passed to the diffusion model. 
    - The diffusion model takes this text (possibly encoded into a suitable representation) and then generates an image based on it.
- Example: generate new content

Terms:
- __Token__ = numerical representation of words or part of words
- __Embedding__ = vector that encodes the meaning of a token
- __Top P__ = threashold probablility for token inclusion (next word)

#### RLHF = Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

Use human feedback to help ML models to self-learn more efficiently.

RLHF incorporates human feedback in the reward function, to be more aligned with human goals and needs
- start with a set of human-generated prompts and responses
- fine-tune an existing model with internal knowledge
- the model’s responses are compared to human’s responses
  - the model creates responses for the human-generated prompts
  - Responses are mathematically compared to human-generated answers
- Build a separate reward model
  - Humans can indicate which response they prefer from the same prompt
  - The reward model can now estimate how a human would prefer a prompt response
- Optimize the language model with the reward-based model
  - Use the reward model as a reward function for RL

RLHF is used throughout GenAI applications including LLM Models

##### How to do reinforcement learning with amazon ?

As of now (2025), Amazon Bedrock does not natively support Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the same way that you might apply RL to train a custom model from scratch

While you can’t train a policy with rewards directly on Bedrock, you can simulate RL-style learning or feedback loops using a hybrid architecture:
- You generate output using a Bedrock-hosted model (e.g., Claude, Jurassic-2).
- Evaluate the output using a reward function (can be human scoring, heuristics, or another model).
- Use the score to select better prompts, re-rank completions, or update your data.


### Use cases <a id="UseCases"></a>

- Expert system (is AI but not ML): if...then rules
- Regression and classification - is ML but not Deep Learning. It can recognize a blue ball from yellow ball (classification)
- Computer vision, Facial recognition, Natural language processing - Deep Learning. We have seen similar facts and we can recognize features of something we have never seen.

### Training Data <a id="TrainingData"></a>

- Labeled vs. Unlabeled Data
  - Labeled Data:
    - Data includes both input features and corresponding output labels
    - Example: dataset with images of animals where each image is labeled with the corresponding animal type (e.g., cat, dog)
    - Use case: Supervised Learning, where the model is trained to map inputs to known outputs
  - Unlabeled Data:
    - Data includes only input features without any output labels
    - Example: a collection of images without any associated labels
    - Use case: Unsupervised Learning, where the model tries to find patterns or structures in the data
- Structured vs. Unstructured Data
  - Structured Data:
    - Data is organized in a structured format, often in rows and column
    - Tabular Data: Data is arranged in a table with rows representing records and columns representing features
    - Time Series Data Data points collected or recorded at successive points in time
  - Unstructured Data
    - Data that doesn't follow a specific structure and is often text-heavy or multimedia content
    - Text Data: Unstructured text such as articles, social media posts, or customer reviews
    - Image Data: Data in the form of images, which can vary widely in format and content

### Model Performance <a id="ModelPerformance"></a>

#### Model Fit:
- __Overfitting__
  - Performs well on the training data
  - Doesn’t perform well on evaluation data
- __Underfitting__
  - Model performs poorly on training data
  - Could be a problem of having a model too simple or poor data features
- __Balanced__: Neither overfitting or underfitting. This is what you want

__What to do if overfitting__?
- Overfitting is when the model gives good predictions for training data but not for the new data
- By overfitting, we mean that the model is __good at making predictions on the data it was trained on__, but not on new data that it hasn't seen before.
So the model has been overfitted to its training data, and it loses some of its predictive capacity
- It occurs due to:
  - Training data size is too small and does not represent all possible input values
  - The model trains too long on a single sample set of data
  - Model complexity is high and learns from the __noise__ within the training data
- How can you __prevent overfitting__?
  - __Increase the training data size__
  - Early stopping the training of the model
  - __Data augmentation__ (to increase diversity in the dataset)
  - __Adjust hyperparameters__
- __K-fold cross validation__: protects against overfitting
  - Split your data into K randomly-assigned segments
  - Reserve one segment as your test data
  - Train on each of the remaining K-1 segments and measure their performance against the test set
  - Take the average of the K-1 r-squared scores
  - Example: You have 100 data points, and you choose K = 5:
    - The dataset is split into 5 equal parts (20 points each)
    - The model is trained and validated 5 times:
      - Train on folds 2–5, validate on fold 1
      - Train on folds 1, 3–5, validate on fold 2
      - Train on folds 1–4, validate on fold 5
    - You then average the validation results (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, F1 score) to get a more stable estimate of model performance.


#### Bias

Difference or error between predicted and actual value
- Occurs due to the wrong choice in the ML process
- __High Bias__
  - The model doesn’t closely match the training data
  - Example: linear regression function on a non-linear dataset
  - Considered as underfitting
  - indicates underfitting, where model is too simple
- __Reducing the Bias__
  - __Use a more complex model__
  - __Increase the number of features__

#### Variance

How much the performance of a model changes if trained on a different dataset which has a similar distribution
- __High Variance__
  - model fits the training data well but performs poorly on new, unseen data
  - Model is __very sensitive to changes in the training data__
  - This is the case when overfitting: performs well on training data, but poorly on unseen test data
- __Reducing the Variance__
  - __Feature selection__ (less, __more important features__)
  - Split into training and test data sets multiple times

![ bias and variance ](./images/abias_and_variance.gif)

Error = Bias^2 + Variance

You want to minimize the error

![ bias and variance 2 ](./images/bias_and_variance_2.gif)
 
#### If Model predictions are not as accurate as desired

Increasing the number of epochs allows the model to learn from the training data for a longer period, potentially capturing more complex patterns and relationships, which can improve accuracy. Multiple epochs are run until the accuracy of the model reaches an acceptable level, or when the error rate drops below an acceptable level.

The company should reduce the batch size, which means processing fewer samples in each training step - Reducing the batch size can make the training process noisier, as each update to the model weights is based on fewer examples. While this might help the model escape local minima during optimization, it does not necessarily lead to an improvement in accuracy and could even slow down convergence or lead to less stable training.

The company should increase regularization to improve the accuracy of the model - Increasing regularization is beneficial when the model is overfitting, as it adds constraints that penalize complexity, encouraging the model to generalize better. However, if the model is already underfitting (not capturing the patterns in the data well), increasing regularization could further decrease its performance, and it might not improve accuracy.

The company should decrease the learning rate, which reduces the size of the steps taken during optimization - Decreasing the learning rate can help the model converge more slowly and steadily, potentially avoiding overshooting the optimal point. However, too small of a learning rate can significantly slow down training and cause the model to get stuck in local minima, thereby not necessarily improving accuracy. It's more of a fine-tuning step once other hyperparameters are appropriately set.


### Model Evaluation Metrics <a id="ModelMetrics"></a>

#### Evaluate binary classification

![ evaluate binary classification ](./images/evaluate_binary_classification.gif)

Confusion Matrix: Best way to evaluate the performance of a model that does classifications

Metrics:
- __Precision__ – Best (1.0) when false positives few
  - Good for medical screening, drug testing. You do not want to do medical procedure if it is not true
- __Recall__ – Best (1.0) when false negatives are few
  - Good for fraud detection (you want to capture all frauds)
  - Recall example:
    - True Positive (TP) - actual fraud was predicted
    - False Negative (FN) = Fraudulent transaction missed → fraudster steals money and gets away with it.
    - False Positive (FP) = Legit transaction flagged as fraud → customer gets annoyed, maybe blocks card, but the money is safe.
    - A high recall means you’re catching most fraud cases.
    - A low recall means many fraud cases go undetected — bad for the business and customers.
- __F1 Score__ – Best when you want a balance between precision and recall, especially in imbalanced datasets
- __Accuracy__ – Best (1.0) for balanced datasets

#### AUC-ROC Area under the curve-receiver operator curve

AUC-ROC stands for Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, and it is a performance metric used to evaluate the quality of binary classification models, especially those that produce probability scores (not just binary outputs).

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots the trade-off between:
- True Positive Rate (TPR) = Recall - Y axis
- False Positive Rate (FPR) - X axis

![ auc roc ](./images/auc_roc.gif)

#### Model Evaluation – Regressions Metrics

![ Regression Metrics ](./images/regression_metrics.gif)

MAE, MAPE, RMSE, R² (R Squared) are used for evaluating models that predict a __continuous value__ (i.e., regressions)

MAE, MAPE, RMSE – measure the error: how “accurate” the model is

R² (R Squared) – measures the variance. If R² is 0.8, this means that 80% of the changes in test scores can be explained

### Machine Learning – Inferencing <a id="Inferencing"></a>

Inferencing is when a model is making prediction on new data
- __Real Time__: make decisions quickly as data arrives. Speed over accuracy. Chatbots
- __Batch__: Large amount of data at once. Speed is not a concern, and accuracy is.
- __Inferencing at the Edge__: less computing power, close to the data:
  - Small Language Model (SLM) on the edge device, Offline capability,
  - Large Language Model (LLM) on a remote server

### Phases of ML project <a id="PhasesOfML"></a>

- Neural networks and trained by gradient descent. We start at some random point and sample different solutions (weights) seeking to minimize some cost function.
- Settings that __define the model structure and learning algorithm and process__
- Set before training begins
- Important hyperparameters:
  - __Learning rate__
    - How large or small the steps are when updating the model's weights during training
    - High learning rate can lead to faster convergence but risks overshooting the optimal solution, while a low learning rate may result in more precise but slower convergence.
  - __Batch size__
    - Number of training examples used to update the model weights in one iteration
    - Smaller batches can lead to more stable learning but require more time to compute, while larger batches are faster but may lead to less stable updates.
  - __Number of Epochs__
    - Refers to how many times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset.
    - Too few epochs can lead to underfitting, while too many may cause overfitting

- Grid search, random search
- Using services such as SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning (AMT)

Used to build __generative (Gen-AI) applications__ i.e. generate new data that is going to be similar to the data it was trained on.
The data can be: text, images, audio, code and video.
It can combine its 'knowledge' in new ways

- Invoke chat, text, or image models
- Pre-built, your own fine-tuned models, or your own models
- Third-party models bill you through AWS via their own pricing
- Support for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation… we’ll get there) - minimize hallucinations?
- Support for LLM agents Serverless
- Can integrate with SageMaker Canvas

Basic characteristics:
- fully managed service
- the __input data never leaves your account__
- pay-per-use pricing model
- unified API: same API for all models that combines foundational model + RAG + your own data queries.
- leverage many foundatrional models like: a121labs, amazon, meta, mistral, anthropic
- out of box features: RAG (more relevant and accurate responses), LLM Agents etc.

Example: train it recognizing dog and cartoon pictures. It will be able to produce images of cartoon dog.

Choosing Base Foundation Model
- model types, performance, capabilities, constraints, compliance
- level of customization, model size (cheaper), inference options, license, context window, latency
- multimodal models (input: audio, text, video -> output: audio, text, video)

Amazon Titan:
- amazon foundation model
- image, text
- can be customised with your own data

- bedrock-runtime: Perform inference (execute prompts, generate embeddings) against these models. Converse, ConverseStream, InvokeModel, InvokeModelWithReponseStream
- bedrock-agent: Manage, deploy, train LLM agents and knowledge bases
- bedrock-agent-runtime: Perform inference against agents and knowledge bases
- InvokeAgent, Retrieve, RetrieveAndGenerate

### Model Fine Tuning <a id="ModelFineTuning"></a>

Fine tuning improves the __performance__, __specificity__, __accuracy__ of a pre-trained FM on domain-specific tasks. It __reduces bias, boosts efficiency__.

__Fine tuning a model can be better than RAG if you use this new model a lot, because your prompts are shorter (cheaper)__.

Add your own data to foundation model. 
Not all models can be fine-tuned.

__Fine-tuning will change the weights of the base foundation model__

You need to provide data that:
- Adhere to a specific format
- Be stored in Amazon S3

If you want to use the __new fine-tuned model - you must use "Provisioned Throughput"__.

Preparing data for fine-tuning:
- quality of data over quantity
- data specific and relevant
- label data correctly
- governance
- combat bias: check for imbalances in data

Methods for __fine tuning a model__:
- __Instruction-based fine-tuning__:
  - It uses __labeled examples__ that are __prompt-response pairs__
  - Example:
```
{
"prompt": "What is AWS",
"completion": "AWS is a ..."
}
```
- __Continued Pre-training__:
  - Called domain-adaptation fine-tuning, to make a model expert in a specific domain
  - Provide __unlabeled data__ to continue the training of an FM
  - Can continue to train the model as more data becomes available
  - Example: feed the entire AWS documentation to a model to make it an expert on AWS
  - Example:
```
{
"input": "Our CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) strategy incorporates a blend of momentum and mean reversion algorithms, 
optimized through a rolling window backtesting methodology. 
The trading signals are generated by analyzing historical price data with a focus on Sharpe ratios and drawdown limits. 
We utilize HFT (High- Frequency Trading) systems to capitalize on short-term price inefficiencies across
various asset classes, including commodities, forex, and equity index futures."
}
```
- __Single-Turn Messaging__:
  - Part of __instruction-based fine-tuning__
  - You need to provide:
    - system (optional) : context for the conversation.
    - messages : An array of message objects, each containing:
      - role : Either user or assistant
      - content : The text content of the message
  - Use: simple question-answer chatbot
  - Example:
```
{
"system": "You are an helpful assistant.",
"messages": [
	{ "role": "user", "content": "what is AWS" },
	{ "role": "assistant", "content": "it's Amazon Web Services." }
 ]
}
```
- __Multi-Turn Messaging__
  - To provide instruction-based fine tuning for a conversation (vs Single-Turn Messaging)
  - Use Chatbots = multi-turn environment
  - You must alternate between “user” and “assistant” roles
  - Example:
```
{
"system": "You are an AI assistant specializing in AWS services.",
"messages": [
	{ "role": "user", "content": "Tell me about Amazon SageMaker.” },
	{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale.” },
	{ "role": "user", "content": "How does it integrate with other AWS services?” },
	{ "role": "assistant", "content": "SageMaker integrates with AWS services like S3 for data storage, Lambda for event-driven computing, and CloudWatch for monitoring.” }
 ]
}
```
- __Transfer Learning__:
  - broader concept of re-using a pre-trained model to adapt it to a new related task.
  - used to image classification or language NLP-type models 
  - The key idea is to leverage the knowledge gained from one problem and apply it to another, reducing the need for large amounts of data and computational resources for the new task.
  - Example: Use the pre-trained image model and adjust it to classify medical images, where you only have a few thousand images labeled for this task.
  - How it works:
    - Pre-training (Source Task): Train a model on a large dataset related to a general task.
    - Fine-tuning: reuse the pre-trained model's learned features.


### Model Evaluation <a id="ModelEvaluation"></a>

- __Automatic Evaluation: judge model__
  - Accuracy, robustness, toxicity
- __Human Evaluation__: human subject matter experts evaluate generated answers
  - Friendliness, style, alignment, brand voice
  - Use in-house staff or AWS-provided reviewers
- Filter content, redact PII
- Enhance content safety and privacy
- Monitor and analyze both inputs and responses

![ Model Evaluation ](./images/model_evaluation.gif)

Metrics:
- __ROUGE__: Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation. 
  - Evaluating automatic __text summarization and machine translation systems__
  - Counts number of overlapping 'units' between computer output and human output
  - ROUGE-N – measure the number of matching n-grams (gram=word) between reference and generated text
  - ROUGE-L – longest common subsequence between reference and generated text
  - Example: 
    - Human: certified AI practitioner
    - Computer output: Certified ML Practitioner
    - ROUGE-N - matching units: 2 (certified, practitioner) / 3 total number of units
    - ROUGE-L = 1
- __BLEU__: Bilingual Evaluation Understudy
  - Evaluate the quality of generated text, especially for __translations__
  - Compares machine translation to human translation
    - checks how many words appear in the reference translation
  - Considers both precision and penalizes too much brevity
- __BERTScore__
  - __Semantic similarity__ between generated text
  - Uses pre-trained BERT models to compare the contextualized embeddings of both texts and computes the cosine similarity between them
- Perplexity: how well the model predicts the next token

### RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation <a id="RAG"></a>

RAG is good to __add new information to the existing model__ like latest results of elections, which was not in the model. 

__Fix hallucinations__ because you provided more relevant data through RAG.

- Allows a Foundation Model to reference a data source outside of its training data
- Bedrock takes care of creating Vector Embeddings in the database of your choice based on your data
- Use where real-time data is needed to be fed into the Foundation Model

![ Bedrock RAG ](./images/bedrock_rag.gif)

Bedrock supports the following vector databases:
- Open Search Service - best
  - real time similarity queries, store millions of vector embeddings, scalable index management, and fast nearest-neighbor (kNN) search capability
- MongoDB (DocumentDB with mongo compatibility)
- Aurora
- RDS for PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Pinecone

Process to populate vector database:
- Documents -> document chunks -> Embeddings Model -> Vector Database

Document Sources:
- Are loaded into __Knowledge Base__
- can be:
  - Amazon S3
  - Confluence
  - Microsoft SharePoint
  - Salesforce
  - Web pages (your website, your social media feed, etc…)

![ RAG Vector Database ](./images/rag_vector_database.gif)

RAG pros:
- Faster & cheaper way to incorporate new or proprietary information into “GenAI” vs. finetuning 
- __Updating info is just a matter of updating a database__
- Can leverage 'semantic search' via vector stores
- Can prevent 'hallucinations' when you ask the model about something it wasn’t trained on
- If your boss wants 'AI search', this is an easy way to deliver it.
- Technically you aren’t 'training' a model with this data

RAG cons:
- You have made the world’s most overcomplicated search engine
- Very sensitive to the prompt templates you use to incorporate your data
- Non-deterministic
- It can still hallucinate
- Very sensitive to the relevancy of the information you retrieve

Choosing a Database for RAG:
- MOST cases: use Vector database. Elasticsearch / Opensearch can function as a vector DB
  - An embedding is just a big vector associated with your data
  - Embeddings are computed such that items that are similar to each other are close to each other in that space
  - Database stores your data alongside their computed embedding vectors
  - Examples of vector databases in AWS
    - Amazon OpenSearch Service (provisioned)
    - Amazon OpenSearch Serverless
    - Amazon MemoryDB
    - pgvector extension in Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for PostgreSQL
    - Amazon Kendra
  - How to do it?
    - Bedrock - use embedding base models (like Titan) to compute embeddings and feed them into vector database
- Graph database (i.e., Neo4j) for retrieving product recommendations or relationships between items
- Elasticsearch/OpenSearch or something for traditional text search (TF/IDF)

RAG process:
- Populate vector database with relevant documents
- Get prompt
- Compute embeddings from the prompt
- Search vector database and use the query vector to find all documents/sentences relevant to your prompt
- Add the found documents to your prompt
- Execute the new prompt.

RAG In Bedrock = Knowledgebase
- upload your docs into S3 
- select embedding model
- add vector store. Control the 'chunking' (How many tokens are represented by each vector).

### Guardrails <a id="Guardrails"></a>

- Control the interaction between users and Foundation Models (FMs)
- __Filter__ undesirable and harmful content
- __Remove__ Personally Identifiable Information (__PII__)
- Enhanced privacy
- Reduce hallucinations
- Ability to create multiple Guardrails
- Content __filtering for prompts and responses__
- __Word and Topic filtering__
- Contextual Grounding Check: Helps prevent hallucination. Measures “grounding” (how similar the response is to the contextual data received)
- Can be incorporated into agents and knowledge bases


### LLM Agents <a id="LLMAgents"></a>

- Manage and carry out various multi-step tasks related to infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and operational activities
- Task coordination: perform tasks in the correct order and ensure information is passed correctly between tasks
- Agents are configured to perform specific pre-defined action groups
- Integrate with other systems, services, databases and API to exchange data or initiate actions

Create Agent Example:
- Define instructions: access purchase history for customer, access recommendations what purchase next and place new orders
- Define Action Groups:
  - expected inputs 
  - group 1: REST APIs to /getRecentPurchases, /getRecommendedPurchases etc ; 
  - group 2: aws lambda: PlaceOrder
- Can add Knowledge base: set of documents about company shipping policy, return policy etc.

Use Agent Example:
- Create a task to Bedrock Agent
- Agent looks at: prompt, conversation history, actions groups, instructions (knowledge base), task and send it to GenAI Bedrock Model
- Agent will ask the model: how to proceed given all this info
- Output of Bedrock model is list of steps (chain of thought)
- Steps are executed by calling APIs from action groups
- Final result is returned back to Bedrock agent that sends this to another Bedrock model to synthesize all info
- Final Final response returned to user.

![ Bedrock Agent ](./images/bedrock_agent.gif)

Amazon Bedrock Agents utilize multiple specialized models to handle different aspects of a task. These models work together to interpret user input, retrieve relevant information, and perform actions.

- The LLM is given discretion on which tools to use for what purpose
- The agent has a memory, an ability to plan how to answer a request, and tools it can use in the process.
- “memory” is just the chat history and external data stores
- the “planning module” is guidance given to the LLM on how to break down a question into subquestions that the tools might be able to help with.
- “Tools” are just functions provided to a tools API.
  - In Bedrock, this can be a Lambda function.
  - Prompts guide the LLM on how to use them.
  - Tools may access outside information, retrievers, other Python modules, services, etc
  - “Action Groups” define a tool
  - You must define the parameters your tool (Lambda function) expects
- Agents may also have knowledge bases associated with them
- Optional “Code Interpreter” allows the agent to write its own code to answer questions or produce charts.

## Prompt Engineering <a id="PromptEngineering"></a>

Prompt Engineering = developing, designing, and optimizing prompts to enhance the output of FMs for your needs.

### Parts of a prompt

Improved Prompting technique consists of:
- Instructions – a task for the model to do (description, how the model should perform)
- Context – external information to guide the model
- Input data – examples, the input 
- Output Indicator – the output type or format

Example:

| Part of prompt  | Content
|-----------------|----------------------
| Instructions	  | "Write a concise summary that captures the main points of an article about learning AWS (AmazonWeb Services). 
|                 | Ensure that the summary is clear and informative, focusing on key services relevant to beginners. 
|                 | Include details about general learning resources and career benefits associated with acquiring AWS skills.
| Context	        | I am teaching a beginner’s course on AWS
| Input Data	    | 'Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud platform providing a variety of services suitable for different business needs. 
|                 | Learning AWS involves getting familiar with essential services like EC2 for computing, S3 for storage, RDS for databases, 
|		  | Lambda for serverless computing, and Redshift for data warehousing. 
|		  | Beginners can start with free courses and basic tutorials available online. 
|		  | The platform also includes more complex services like Lambda for serverless computing and Redshift for data warehousing, which are suited for advanced users. s
|		  | The article emphasizes the value of understanding AWS for career advancement and the availability of numerous certifications to validate cloud skills.
| Output Indicator| Provide a 2-3 sentence summary that captures the essence of the article.

Expected Output for this prompt: 
"AWS offers a range of essential cloud services such as EC2 for computing, S3 for storage, RDS for databases, Lambda for serverless computing, and Redshift for data warehousing, which are crucial for beginners to learn.
Beginners can utilize free courses and basic tutorials to build their understanding of AWS. Acquiring AWS skills is
valuable for career advancement, with certifications available to validate expertise in cloud computing."

### Negative prompting

Explicitly instruct the model on what not to include or do in its response

Negative Prompting helps to:
- Avoid Unwanted Content
- Maintain Focus
- Enhance Clarity

### Prompt performance in Bedrock

- __System Prompts__ – how the model should behave and reply
- __Temperature__ (0 to 1) – creativity of the model’s output
  - Low (ex: 0.2) – outputs are more repetitive, focused on most likely response
  - High (ex: 1.0) – outputs are more diverse, creative, and unpredictable, maybe less coherent
- __Top P__ (0 to 1)
  - Low P (ex: 0.25) – consider the 25% most likely words, will make a more coherent response
  - High P (ex: 0.99) – consider a broad range of possible words, possibly more creative and diverse output
- __Top K__ – limits the number of probable words (similar to P)
  - Low K (ex: 10) – more coherent response, less probable words
 - High K (ex: 500) – more probable words, more diverse and creative
- __Length__ – maximum length of the answer
- __Stop Sequences__ – tokens that signal the model to stop generating output

__Prompt latency:__
- It’s impacted by: 
  - model size, 
  - model type (Llama vs Claude)
  - number of tokens in the input
  - number of tokens in the output
- __Latency is not impacted by: Top P, Top K, Temperature__

#### Prompting techniques

##### Zero-shot prompting

Present a task to the model without providing examples or explicit training for that specific task

##### Few-Shots Prompting

Provide few examples of a task to the model to guide its output

- Step 1: Create Few-Shot Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: "Where is my order?"
Output: "Order Status"

Example 2:
Input: "I want to return a product I bought."
Output: "Return Request"
```

- Step 2: Create the Few-Shot Prompt for the Model
  - You prompt the model with a new user query, you include the examples above to help the model understand the task

```
You are a customer support agent. Below are examples of customer inquiries and their respective intents:

Example 1:
Input: "Where is my order?"
Output: "Order Status"

Example 2:
Input: "I want to return a product I bought."
Output: "Return Request"
```

- Expected Output: After seeing the above prompt with examples, the model should output something like

```
Output: "Order Status"
```

##### Chain of Thought Prompting

- Divide the task into a sequence of reasoning steps, leading to more structure and coherence
- Using a sentence like "Think step by step" helps
- Example: 
```
Let’s write a story about a dog solving a mystery.
First, describe the setting and the dog.
Then, introduce the mystery.
Next, show how the dog discovers clues.
Finally, reveal how the dog solves the mystery and conclude the story.
Write a short story following this plan. Think step by step
```

##### RAG

Combine the model’s capability with external data sources to generate a more informed and contextually rich response

### Prompt templates

Simplify and standardize the process of generating Prompts

Helps with
- Processes user input text and output prompts from foundation models (FMs)
- Orchestrates between the FM, action groups, and knowledge bases
- Formats and returns responses to the user

Protecting against prompt injections:  Add explicit instructions to ignore any unrelated or potential malicious content

- Use cases: image classification, data collection, business processing
- Integrates with Amazon A2I, SageMaker Ground Truth

#### Amazon Mechanical Turk vs Ground Truth

- Subjective Sentiment Analysis: 
  - Sentiment is inherently subjective, and different individuals may interpret the same text in different ways. A model trained on ground truth data may not fully capture nuances like sarcasm, irony, or context, and human judgment is needed for accurate sentiment classification.
  - Example: Classifying a review of a restaurant: "The food was okay, but the waiter was really rude." Sentiment analysis models might struggle with this mixed review, but human workers can correctly identify it as a neutral or negative sentiment.
- Image Captioning and Interpretation:
  - Ground truth might have captions, but those are typically simple, pre-defined descriptions. Some images require complex contextual understanding, such as cultural context, emotions
  - Example: Given a photo of a crowded street with street vendors, MTurk workers can generate captions that describe not just what is visible but also provide context like the type of market or possible cultural significance.


### Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)

#### Model Predictions: SageMaker Clarify + SageMaker Experiments

##### Shapley Values
- A 'feature' is some property you are trying to make predictions from
  - For example: you might try to predict income based on features such as age, education level, location, etc. 
- Basically evaluates your models with each feature left out, and measures the impact of the missing feature
- From that we can measure the relative importance of each feature
- Example: How should the total payout be fairly divided among the players based on their individual contributions?
- Local: Explains a single prediction

How it works:
- Imagine every possible order in which features could be added to the model.
- For each ordering, measure how much adding a feature changes the prediction.
- Average that change over all possible orderings.

##### Partial Dependence Plot

Helps you understand the relationship between one or more input features and the predicted outcome of a model. 
It shows how the average prediction changes as you vary one feature, while keeping all others fixed in the data.

Example: On average, what does the model predict when house size is X, regardless of other features?

Global: Show average behavior of model

How it works:
- Take the dataset with all your input features.
- Choose a range of values for feature xjxj​.
- For each value vv in that range:
  - Replace feature xjxj​ with vv for every instance in the dataset.
  - Predict using the model on these modified inputs.
  - Average the predictions.
- Plot the average prediction versus the feature value vv.


#### Model selection:
- Use model evaluation in SageMaker or Bedrock
- Define your use-case narrowly:
  - What could go wrong? What might mess up your model, and in what way?
  - What levers do you need for tuning to mitigate those issues?
- Test how a model performs with your data
  - Don’t choose based on general benchmarks, choose on how it performs for your specific problem

#### Responsible Dataset:
- Balance your data
  - Using SageMaker Data Wrangler or SageMaker Clarify
  - Data cleaning, feature selection, normalization are some pre-processing techniques

- __Global Explainability__: Explains the __overall model behavior__. Aggregates SHAP values across all predictions. Tells you which features are generally most important

Detect Bias (human)
- Ability to detect and explain biases in your datasets and models
- Measure bias using statistical metrics
- Specify input features and bias will be automatically detected

Types of bias:
- Sampling bias: Sampling bias occurs when the training data does not represent the full population fairly

- Observer bias: Observer bias happens when the person collecting or interpreting the data has personal biases that affect the results
- Confirmation bias: Confirmation bias is when individuals interpret or favor information that confirms their preconceptions.

### Interpretability

- The degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision
- extent to which you can get into the inner weights of the model and understand it

## Questions <a id="Questions"></a>

### A data scientist is working on a binary classification problem to predict whether a customer will churn. They want to select the best metric to evaluate their model’s performance, given that the cost of a false negative (predicting a customer will not churn when they will) is much higher than a false positive. Which evaluation metric should the data scientist use to prioritize reducing false negatives?

Recall

Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified by the model. In this case, where false negatives are more costly, recall is crucial as it prioritizes minimizing false negatives, making it the most suitable metric for evaluating the model's performance.

This means no one has instructed or trained the model with labeled training data sets.

__Incorrect options__:

Reinforcement learning - Reinforcement learning is a method with reward values attached to the different steps that the algorithm must go through. So the model’s goal is to accumulate as many reward points as possible and eventually reach an end goal.

Supervised learning - In supervised learning, models are supplied with labeled and defined training data to assess for correlations. The sample data specifies both the input and the output for the model. For example, images of handwritten figures are annotated to indicate which number they correspond to. A supervised learning system could recognize the clusters of pixels and shapes associated with each number, given sufficient examples.

Data labeling is the process of categorizing input data with its corresponding defined output values. Labeled training data is required for supervised learning. For example, millions of apple and banana images would need to be tagged with the words “apple” or “banana.” Then machine learning applications could use this training data to guess the name of the fruit when given a fruit image.

Unsupervised learning - Unsupervised learning algorithms train on unlabeled data. They scan through new data, trying to establish meaningful connections between the inputs and predetermined outputs. They can spot patterns and categorize data. For example, unsupervised algorithms could group news articles from different news sites into common categories like sports, crime, etc. They can use natural language processing to comprehend meaning and emotion in the article.
