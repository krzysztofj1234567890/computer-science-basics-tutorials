Groton is part of the greater Boston metropolitan area, but it is very much a small New England town. The town takes pride in the fact that a little over 40% of the land in town is protected by the town, state, or through private organizations & trusts, and is accessible to the public. 

Groton started with the trading post of John Tinker, who conducted business there with the Nashaway at the confluence of Nod Brook and the Nashua River. It incorporated as a town in 1655, and named for Groton in Suffolk, England. Called The Plantation of Groton, it included all of present-day Groton and Ayer, almost all of Pepperell and Shirley, large parts of Dunstable, Littleton, and Tyngsborough, plus smaller parts of Harvard and Westford in Massachusetts, as well as Nashua and Hollis, New Hampshire. During King Philip's War, on March 13, 1676, Native Americans burned all buildings except for four Groton garrisons. during King William's War, on July 27, 1694 a group of native warriors raided the town killing some 20 people,and took captive some 13 others. On April 19, 1775, word arrived of fighting in Lexington & Concord. The common in Groton was used as a staging area for two companies of Minutemen under the command of Colonel William Prescott before beginning the march to Concord.
