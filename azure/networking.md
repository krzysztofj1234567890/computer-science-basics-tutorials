# Azure ExpressRoute

Lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection with the help of a connectivity provider. 
With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365.

ExpressRoute connections offer more reliability, faster speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet, because they donâ€™t go over the public Internet.

ExpressRoute connections use a private, dedicated connection through a third-party connectivity provider. The private connection extends your on-premises network into Azure.

# Azure Private Link

Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual network.

Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network. 
Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary. 
You can create your own private link service in your virtual network and deliver it to your customers.
