## How do I oversee implementation of large-scale software architecture?

- Define and Communicate the Architectural Vision
  - Create high-level architecture diagrams (services, data flow, boundaries)
  - Clearly define principles (e.g. modularity, scalability, eventual consistency)
  - Identify key non-functional requirements (e.g. latency, availability, maintainability)
- Break It Down Into Subsystems
  - Decompose architecture into domains, bounded contexts, and modules
  - Assign teams to clear domains of responsibility
  - Define APIs or contracts between systems early
- Establish Governance & Standards
  - Set up coding standards, testing protocols, CI/CD policies, and architectural review boards
  - Create templates and reference implementations for common concerns
- Enable Observability from Day One
- Create Feedback Loops with Development Teams
  - Run architecture syncs, office hours, and design reviews
  - Collect feedback on pain points and technical debt
- Review Progress and Adjust Design When Needed
  - Are key architectural goals being met (e.g. latency, modularity)?
  - Are teams building throwaway scaffolding or anti-patterns?
  - Is the system evolving as planned or diverging?
- Foster a Culture of Ownership and Empowerment
  - Avoid being the “architecture bottleneck”
  - Delegate technical ownership to team leads

## How to ensure alignment between business needs and technical solutions?

- Start with Business Outcomes, Not Features

- Embed Product Owners or Business Analysts in Tech Teams
  - Ensure there is a constant feedback loop between business and engineering.
  - Business representatives should be available daily, not just at sprint planning.

- Use Collaborative Design Techniques

| Technique            | Benefit                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Event Storming       | Align on processes and data         |
| Domain-Driven Design | Clarifies business terminology      |
| Impact Mapping       | Connects features to business goals |
| User Story Mapping   | Shows user flows + dependencies     |

- Define and Validate Assumptions Early

- Establish Shared Language and Glossary

- Tie Technical Metrics to Business Value

| Technical Metric           | Business Relevance             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Page load time             | Conversion rate                |
| Service uptime             | Revenue impact, SLA compliance |
| MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) | Customer satisfaction, churn   |
| Code delivery frequency    | Speed to market                |
