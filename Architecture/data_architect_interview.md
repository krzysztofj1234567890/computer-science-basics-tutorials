# Prepare for Data Architect Interview

## End-to-End Data Architecture Design

### Data Architecture patterns

- __Medallion Architecture__ (also called Bronze → Silver → Gold or Multi-layer Lakehouse)

  | Layer  | Content                              | Data Quality / Schema            | Typical Consumers                     | Format Examples                       |
  |--------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
  | Bronze | Raw data "as arrived"                | Almost none                      | Data engineers (replay, debug)        | Parquet / Avro / JSON on object store |
  | Silver | Cleansed, conformed, lightly modeled | Good quality, enforced types     | Analysts, data scientists,            | Delta / Iceberg / Hudi tables         |
  | Gold   | Aggregated, business-ready, dimensional models | High quality, governed | BI tools, executives, Apps, AI agents | Same open formats / semantic layer    |
- Platform-level Architectural Paradigms
  - __Data Lakehouse__ (currently the fastest-growing pattern)
    - One copy of data (usually on object storage)
    - Open table format (Iceberg, Delta Lake, Hudi most popular in 2026)
    - ACID transactions + schema evolution + time travel
    - Multiple engines can read/write (Spark, Trino, Snowflake, DuckDB, Polars, AI tools…)
  - __Data Mesh__
    - Organizational/social paradigm more than purely technical
    - Domain-oriented data products (each business domain owns & publishes its data)
    - Data is treated like a product (discoverable, addressable, trustworthy, self-describing)
    - Decentralized ownership + centralized standards & discoverability
    - Best when: >1,000–2,000 engineers or very autonomous business units
  - __Data Fabric__
    - Data stays where it lives (Salesforce, SAP, Snowflake warehouse, Databricks lakehouse, Azure SQL DB, S3 raw files, Kafka streams, on-prem Oracle, etc.).
    - A fabric layer (active metadata + automation) discovers, catalogs, virtualizes, governs, and sometimes lightly transforms data without forcing mass movement.
    - You query through a unified semantic / virtual view — it often looks like one big database to the user/analyst/AI agent.
    - Metadata-driven, automated integration & governance layer
    - Active metadata + AI-assisted discovery, lineage, access control
    - Virtual views across heterogeneous sources (no massive copying)
    - Goal: "find, understand, use any data without 50 ETL jobs"
    - Data Fabric on AWS:
      - storage: S3
      - metadata catalog: AWS Lake Formation + AWS Glue Data Catalog
      - federation: AWS Athena or ResShift Spectrum or Trino
      - Integration: AWS Glue + Lambda
      - Semantic layer: dbt semantic / cubeJS
      - Governance + Security: AWS IAM, Macie, LakeFormation
      - Observability: CloudWatch
      - AI: Sagemaker, Bedrock
    - Data Fabric on Azure:
      - Storage: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: bronze->silver->gold
        - ADLS Gen2: enhanced mode of Blob Storage: +Hierarchical namespace, Fine-grained security
      - metadata catalog: Microsoft Purview: ADLS Gen2, Blob Storage, AzureSQL, CosmosDB: automated scanning, scehma extraction, lineage
      - federation (query across data):
        - Azure Synapse Analytics (serverless SQL, external tables)
        - Azure Databricks (Delta Lake, SQL endpoints)
      - integration (ETL / pipelines): Azure Data Factory, Azure Functions
      - semantic layer: power BI (semantic models) or dbt (runs on Synapse / Databricks)
      - governance + security: Microsoft Purview, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault
      - observability: Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics
      - AI / ML: Azure Machine Learning, Azure OpenAI Service

    | Component                 | Purpose                                                            | Typical Tech Examples (2026)                                 |
    |---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Active Metadata Engine    | Continuously crawls/scans sources, builds knowledge graph of data  | Atlan, Collibra, Alation, Microsoft Purview + AI extensions  |
    | Data Catalog & Discovery  | Self-service search + lineage + "find similar datasets"            | Above + embedded AI recommendations                          |
    | Federated Query Engine    | Push-down queries to source systems when possible                  | Starburst/Trino, Dremio, Presto variants, Snowflake External Tables |
    | Virtualization / Views    | Create unified views without copying data                          | dbt Semantic Layer + virtualization, Denodo, IBM watsonx.data |
    | Automated Integration     | AI-suggested or auto-generated light transforms when needed        | Informatica CLAIRE, Talend AI, Matillion AI                  |
    | Policy & Access Enforceme | Consistent RBAC, data masking, compliance across all sources       | Immuta, Okera (legacy), Purview + integrations               |

## AI/ML + Data Architecture

Supporting AI means shifting from just “tables for analysts” to a flexible, high-throughput, ML-ready data platform

| Aspect    | Traditional BI         | AI / ML Workloads                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Type | Structured, curated    | Structured, semi-structured, unstructured (text, images, video, logs, time-series) |
| Latency   | Minutes → hours        | Seconds → real-time (for streaming or inference)                                   |
| Volume    | Moderate               | Very large (TBs → PBs)                                                             |
| Schema    | Fixed, schema-on-write | Flexible, schema-on-read (especially for raw / feature data)                       |
| Users     | Analysts               | Data scientists, ML engineers, AI researchers                                      |

### Feature stores

| Characteristic                              | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Online & Offline stores**                 | Separate low-latency (real-time) and batch (training) stores            |
| **As-of feature retrieval**                 | Can retrieve features as-of a specific timestamp → avoids label leakage |
| **Versioning / history**                    | Automatically tracks feature changes over time                          |
| **Consistency across training & inference** | Guarantees features used in training match what’s served to models      |
| **Data validation & schema enforcement**    | Ensures feature types, dimensions, and constraints are correct          |
| **Integration with SageMaker ML pipelines** | Native integration for training, batch transform, endpoints             |
| **Automatic indexing**                      | Fast retrieval for online inference with low latency                    |
| **Metadata tracking**                       | Supports lineage, dataset documentation, and monitoring                 |

Features are derived or computed from raw data, and they can change over time due to:
- Business logic changes: You redefine active_user to include mobile + web
- Data updates / corrections: A customer’s last purchase was recorded late or corrected

How to use Feature Store:
- Define a feature group: A Feature Group is like a table for your features.
  ```
  customer_features.create(
    s3_uri=f"s3://my-bucket/feature-store/",
    record_identifier_name='customer_id',
    event_time_feature_name='event_time',
    role_arn='arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:role/service-role/AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-2026',
    enable_online_store=True,
    feature_definitions=feature_group_definition
  )
  ```
- Ingest data into Feature Store
  ```
  df = pd.DataFrame({
      'customer_id': ['C001', 'C002'],
      'age': [34, 27],
      'signup_days_ago': [100, 250],
      'avg_purchase_last_30_days': [120.5, 80.0],
      'event_time': [datetime.now(), datetime.now()]
  })

  customer_features.put_record(df.iloc[0].to_dict())
  customer_features.put_record(df.iloc[1].to_dict())
  ```
- Retrieve features for training
  - Use the offline store (Parquet in S3) to get features for model training:
  ```
  query = f"""
  SELECT customer_id, age, signup_days_ago, avg_purchase_last_30_days
  FROM "{feature_group_name}"
  WHERE event_time <= '2026-03-21 00:00:00'
  """
  # Use Athena or Glue to query the offline store
  import boto3
  athena = boto3.client('athena')

  response = athena.start_query_execution(
      QueryString=query,
      QueryExecutionContext={'Database': 'feature_store_database'},
      ResultConfiguration={'OutputLocation': 's3://my-bucket/query-results/'}
  )
  ```
- Use features to train a model
  ```
  import xgboost as xgb

  # Assume df_train contains features retrieved from Feature Store + target column
  X_train = df_train[['age', 'signup_days_ago', 'avg_purchase_last_30_days']]
  y_train = df_train['churn']

  model = xgb.XGBClassifier()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  ```

### Training vs inference pipelines

### Vector databases (for LLMs)

### Data versioning

Data versioning is the process of tracking and storing changes to datasets over time, similar to how Git tracks code.

| Reason                                | Example / Impact                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reproducibility**                   | You can train the same model again and get the same results.                       |
| **Training vs Inference consistency** | Features used in training match what’s served in production.                       |
| **Auditability / Compliance**         | Regulatory requirements often require tracking what data was used for predictions. |
| **Debugging & Experimentation**       | Easy to roll back to a previous dataset if a model fails.                          |
| **Collaboration**                     | Teams can work on different “versions” of datasets without conflict.               |

## Leadership & Strategy

### “How do you influence product teams?”

- requirements, __goals__, vision: What decisions are you trying to make?
- Translate data work into __product impact__: This ensures your feature usage data is always queryable and doesn’t break dashboards
- Reduce friction: Provide self-service pipeline
- Create opinionated standards: 
- Embed with teams: Join sprint discussions, Sit in product reviews

### “How do you handle disagreements with leadership?”

- Start by understanding why they think differently
- Reframe your argument in business terms: “This isn’t scalable” vs risk, cost, time-to-market
- Bring options, not objections

### “How do you define a data strategy?”

A data strategy is a plan for how your organization uses data to make better decisions and build better products.

- Start with business outcomes (always): What decisions do we want to improve?
- Define the critical data domains: you need the right data
- Build the capabilities (the “how”): ingestion, storage, processing+integration, consumption, governance
- operating model: who owns data, how are data sets created, 
- Establish metrics for the data strategy itself: data quality scores, time to access, 

### Driving architecture decisions

- Anchor every decision in a clear problem: We need to process 5TB/day with low latency and support data science workflows.
- Make trade-offs explicit: Fast to deliver, harder to scale
- Bring structured options: Option B: Azure Databricks (pros/cons): cost, time-to-deliver, risk, long term implications
- Create “default patterns” instead of one-off decisions: All raw data lands in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Involve stakeholders early: Bring engineers, product, and analytics into the discussion early
- Use data and examples to support decisions
- Document decisions (lightweight but clear)

### Scaling a data platform

### Handling production incidents

### Mentoring teams
