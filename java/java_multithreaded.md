# Java Multithreading

Java supports multithreading through Thread class. Java Thread allows us to create a lightweight process that executes some tasks. We can create multiple threads in our program and start them

## Singleton

### Simple singleton

If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the approach to use. But in most of the scenarios, singleton classes are created for resources such as File System, Database connections, etc. We should avoid the instantiation unless the client calls the getInstance method.

```
public class EagerInitializedSingleton {
    private static final EagerInitializedSingleton instance = new EagerInitializedSingleton();
    // private constructor to avoid client applications using the constructor
    private EagerInitializedSingleton(){}
    public static EagerInitializedSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Thread Safe Singleton

```
public class ThreadSafeSingleton {
    private static ThreadSafeSingleton instance;
    private ThreadSafeSingleton(){}
    public static synchronized ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

or better (reduces the performance because of the cost associated with the synchronized method):

```
public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstanceUsingDoubleLocking() {
    if (instance == null) {
        synchronized (ThreadSafeSingleton.class) {
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
            }
        }
    }
    return instance;
}
```

## Create and use Thread in java

### Create thread

Thread life cycle:
- New
- Runnable
- Running
- Blocked/Waiting
- Dead

#### Runnable

```
Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable(){
    @Override
    public void run() {
    }
});
```

OR 

```
Runnable runnable = () -> System.out.println("Hello");
```

OR 

```
public class LiftOff implements Runnable { 
 protected int countDown = 10; // Default 
 private static int taskCount = 0; 
 private final int id = taskCount++; 
 public LiftOff() {} 
 public LiftOff(int countDown) { 
    this.countDown = countDown; 
 } 
 public String status() { 
    return "#" + id + "(" + 
        (countDown > 0 ? countDown : "Liftoff!") + "), "; 
 } 
 public void run() { 
    while(countDown-- > 0) { 
        System.out.print(status()); 
        Thread.yield(); 
    } 
 } 
} 
```

run( ) method usually has some kind of loop that continues until the task is no longer necessary, so you must establish the condition on which to break out of this loop.

The call to the static method Thread.yield( ) inside run( ) is a suggestion to the thread scheduler that says, "I’ve done the important parts of my cycle and this would be a good time 
to switch to another task for a while.

#### Callable

A __Runnable__ is a separate task that performs work, but it doesn’t return a value. If you want the task to produce a value when it’s done, you can implement the __Callable__ interface rather than the Runnable interface

Callable is a generic with a type parameter representing the return value from the method call( ) (instead of run( )), and must be invoked using an ExecutorService submit( ) method.

```
class TaskWithResult implements Callable<String> { 
 private int id; 
 public TaskWithResult(int id) { 
    this.id = id; 
 } 
 public String call() { 
    return "result of TaskWithResult " + id; 
 } 
} 
```

### Run a thread

#### Runnable

The traditional way to turn a Runnable object into a working task is to hand it to a Thread constructor.

```
public class BasicThreads { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
    Thread t = new Thread(new LiftOff()); 
    t.start(); 
    System.out.println("Waiting for LiftOff"); 
 } 
} 
```

Executors provide a layer of indirection between a client and the  execution of a task; instead of a client executing a task directly, an intermediate object 
executes the task. Executors allow you to manage the execution of asynchronous tasks without having to explicitly manage the lifecycle of threads

We can use an Executor instead of explicitly creating Thread objects

```
public class CachedThreadPool { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
    ExecutorService exec = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); 
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
        exec.execute(new LiftOff()); 
                                                           
    exec.shutdown();
 } 
} 

```

The call to shutdown( ) prevents new tasks from being submitted to that Executor. The current thread (in this case, the one driving main( )) will continue to run all tasks submitted 
before shutdown( ) was called. The program will exit as soon as all the tasks in the Executor finish. 

#### Callable

The submit( ) method produces a Future object, parameterized for the particular type of result returned by the Callable. You can query the Future with isDone( ) to see if it has 
completed. When the task is completed and has a result, you can call get( ) to fetch the result. You can simply call get( ) without checking isDone( ), in which case get( ) will block 
until the result is ready. You can also call get( ) with a timeout.

```
public class CallableDemo { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
 ExecutorService exec = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); 
 ArrayList<Future<String>> results = new ArrayList<Future<String>>(); 
 for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
    results.add(exec.submit(new TaskWithResult(i))); 
 for(Future<String> fs : results) 
    try { 
        // get() blocks until completion: 
        System.out.println(fs.get()); 
    } catch(InterruptedException e) { 
        System.out.println(e); 
        return; 
    } catch(ExecutionException e) { 
        System.out.println(e); 
    } finally { 
        exec.shutdown(); 
    } 
 } 
}
```

#### Yielding

When you call yield( ), you are suggesting that other threads of the same priority might be run.

#### Daemon threads

A "daemon" thread is intended to provide a general service in the background as long as the 
program is running, but is not part of the essence of the program. Thus, __when all of the non-daemon threads complete, the program is terminated, killing all daemon threads__ in the 
process.

If there are any non-daemon threads still running, the program doesn’t terminate.

You must set the thread to be a daemon by calling setDaemon( ) before it is started.

```
public class SimpleDaemons implements Runnable { 
 public void run() { 
    try { 
        while(true) { 
            TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(100); 
            print(Thread.currentThread() + " " + this); 
        } 
    } catch(InterruptedException e) { 
        print("sleep() interrupted"); 
    } 
 } 
 public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { 
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
        Thread daemon = new Thread(new SimpleDaemons()); 
        daemon.setDaemon(true); // Must call before start() 
        daemon.start(); 
    } 
    print("All daemons started"); 
    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(175); 
 } 
}
```

#### Joining a thread

One thread may call join( ) on another thread to wait for the second thread to complete before proceeding. If a thread calls t.join( ) on another thread t, then the calling thread is 
suspended until the target thread t finishes.

#### Catching exceptions

Because of the nature of threads, you can’t catch an exception that has escaped from a thread.

Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.uncaughtException( ) is automatically called when that thread is about to die from an uncaught exception.

```
class ExceptionThread2 implements Runnable { 
 public void run() { 
    Thread t = Thread.currentThread(); 
    System.out.println("run() by " + t); 
    System.out.println( 
    "eh = " + t.getUncaughtExceptionHandler()); 
    throw new RuntimeException(); 
 } 
} 
class MyUncaughtExceptionHandler implements Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler { 
    public void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e) { 
    System.out.println("caught " + e); 
 } 
} 
class HandlerThreadFactory implements ThreadFactory { 
 public Thread newThread(Runnable r) { 
    System.out.println(this + " creating new Thread"); 
    Thread t = new Thread(r); 
    System.out.println("created " + t); 
    t.setUncaughtExceptionHandler( new MyUncaughtExceptionHandler()); 
    System.out.println( "eh = " + t.getUncaughtExceptionHandler()); 
    return t; 
 } 
} 
public class CaptureUncaughtException { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
    ExecutorService exec = Executors.newCachedThreadPool( 
    new HandlerThreadFactory()); 
    exec.execute(new ExceptionThread2()); 
 } 
}
```

### Resolving shared resource contention

#### Synchronized

All concurrency schemes serialize access to shared resources. This means that only one task at a time is allowed to access the shared resource.

To prevent collisions over resources, Java has built-in support in the form of the synchronized keyword. When a task wishes to execute a piece of code guarded by the 
synchronized keyword, it checks to see if the lock is available, then acquires it, executes the code, and releases it. 

```
public class SynchronizedEvenGenerator extends IntGenerator { 
 private int currentEvenValue = 0; 
 public synchronized int next() { 
    ++currentEvenValue; 
    Thread.yield(); // Cause failure faster 
    ++currentEvenValue; 
    return currentEvenValue; 
 } 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
    EvenChecker.test(new SynchronizedEvenGenerator()); 
 } 
}
```

#### Atomicity

Atomic operations are thus not interruptible by the threading mechanism.

Changes made by one task, even if they’re atomic in the  sense of not being interruptible, might not be visible to other tasks (the changes might be 
temporarily stored in a local processor cache, for example), so different tasks will have a different view of the application’s state.

##### Volatile

If you declare a field to be __volatile__, this means that as soon as a write occurs for that field, all reads will see the change. 
This is true even if local caches are involved—volatile fields are immediately written through to main memory, and reads occur from main memory. 

An atomic operation on a non-volatile field will not necessarily be flushed to main memory, and so another task that reads that field will not necessarily see the new value. 
If multiple tasks are accessing a field, that field should be volatile; otherwise, the field should only be accessed 
via synchronization. Synchronization also causes flushing to main memory, so if a field is 
completely guarded by synchronized methods or blocks, it is not necessary to make it volatile.

##### Atomiclnteger, AtomicLong etc.

These are for fine-tuning to use machine-level atomicity that is available on some modern processors, so you generally don’t need to worry about using them

##### ThreadLocal

A second way to prevent tasks from colliding over shared resources is to eliminate the sharing of variables. Thread local storage is a mechanism that automatically creates 
different storage for the same variable, for each different thread that uses an object.

If you have five threads using an object with a variable x, thread local storage generates five different pieces of storage for x.

```
// create
ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalValue = new ThreadLocal<>();

// use
threadLocalValue.set(1);
Integer result = threadLocalValue.get();
```

### Terminating tasks

Thread.stop(), but it just kills the thread and may leave your application in an inconsistent state. This can be done easier with just calling System.exit().

#### InterruptedException

When a thread is interrupted, it throws an InterruptedException. It's essential to catch this exception and handle it appropriately. 

Thread provides the interrupt() method for interrupting a thread. Some code can call the interrupt() method on our thread.

To query whether a thread has been interrupted, we can use the isInterrupted() method.

Each thread has a boolean property that represents its interrupted status. Invoking Thread.interrupt() sets this flag. When a thread checks for an interrupt by invoking the static method Thread.interrupted(), the interrupt status is cleared.

Someone interrupted your thread. That someone is probably eager to cancel the operation, terminate the program gracefully, or whatever. You should be polite to that someone and return from your method without further ado.

##### Solution 1
The best solution here is to let the InterruptedException propagate through the method call stack, by appending each relevant method signature with the throws InterruptedException statement. This might seem like an easy cop out solution at first glance, but it is, in fact, the correct solution.


##### Solution 2
In the following example, TestThread works periodically after every 2 seconds. It checks if it has been interrupted or not. If not, it continues working, finishes the processing and returns. If it is interrupted in between by another Thread, it can terminate gracefully by throwing InterruptedException to the caller Thread.

```
public class TestThread extends Thread {  
	public void run() {  
		try{
			while(true) {  
                // Check if it is interrupted, if so then throw InterruptedException
				if(Thread.interrupted()) {  
					throw new InterruptedException();
				}  
                // else continue working
				else {  
					System.out.println("Continue working");  
				}  
                Thread.sleep(2000L);
			}
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // Handling InterruptedException and Graceful shutdown of the Thread
			System.out.println("Graceful shutdown"); 
		}
	}  
}
```

#### Shutdown Hooks

The JVM allows registering functions to run before it completes its shutdown. These functions are usually a good place for releasing resources or other similar house-keeping tasks.

```
Thread printingHook = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("In the middle of a shutdown"));
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(printingHook);
```

```
package com.tutorialspoint;

class CustomThread extends Thread {
   public void run() {
      System.out.println("JVM is shutting down.");
   }
}

public class TestThread {
   public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException {
      try {
         // register CustomThread as shutdown hook
         Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new CustomThread());
         // print the state of the program
         System.out.println("Program is starting...");
         // cause thread to sleep for 3 seconds
         System.out.println("Waiting for 3 seconds...");
         Thread.sleep(3000);
         // print that the program is closing
         System.out.println("Program is closing...");
      } catch (Exception e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
```

OR

```
public class TestShutdownHook {  
      // shutdown hook thread can be used to perform cleaning of resources.  
      private static class ShutDownHook extends Thread {  
           public void run() {  
                System.out.println("shutdown hook thread started");  
           }  
      }  
      public static void main(String[] args) {  
           ShutDownHook jvmShutdownHook = new ShutDownHook();  
           Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(jvmShutdownHook);  
           System.out.println("Register Shutdown Hook");  
           System.out.println("calling System.exit() to close the program");  
           System.exit(0);  
           System.out.println("Program Finished");  
      }  
 }  
```

# Java Data structures

The collection classes that are thread-safe in Java are __Stack__, __Vector__, __Properties__, __Hashtable__, etc.

## Collections.synchronizedCollection() 

Returns a thread-safe collection backed up by the specified Collection.

```
Collection<Integer> syncCollection = Collections.synchronizedCollection(new ArrayList<>());
    Runnable listOperations = () -> {
        syncCollection.addAll(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6));
    };
    
    Thread thread1 = new Thread(listOperations);
    Thread thread2 = new Thread(listOperations);
    thread1.start();
    thread2.start();
    thread1.join();
    thread2.join();
    
    assertThat(syncCollection.size()).isEqualTo(12);
}

```
## Collections.synchronizedList()

The method returns a thread-safe view of the specified List:
```
List<Integer> syncList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
```


## Collections.synchronizedSortedMap

### ConcurrentHashMap



# Thread Safety in Java

Make our program safe to use in multithreaded environment:
- __Synchronization__ is the easiest and most widely used tool for thread safety in java.
- Use of __Atomic Wrapper classes__ from java.util.concurrent.atomic package. For example AtomicInteger
- Use of __locks__ from java.util.concurrent.locks package.
- Using __thread safe collection__ classes, check this post for usage of ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety.
- Using __volatile__ keyword with variables to make every thread read the data from memory, not read from thread cache.
