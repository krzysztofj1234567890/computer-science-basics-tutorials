## Virtual Machines

### Definition

* A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. 
* One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  
* Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VM

### why use VMs?

* computer idle time
* reuse of computer resources
* automation
* isolation
* easy migrationto new hardware

## Docker and Containers

### Functions

* Docker enables application portability
* Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
* Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
* Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services.
